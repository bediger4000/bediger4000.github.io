<p>Sometimes I want to FTP a file from one machine to another.
Usually, I can do the transfer interactively, but every so often, I
would like to have a shell script do the file transfer. This task
has eluded me in the past, but I finally figured it out. I've not
seen this particular trick documented in the past, so I submit it
for your approval.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The problem I always encountered in scripting ftp transfers
involved getting a password to the ftp server. Typical ftp client
programs under Unix, Linux, Solaris and NetBSD all read the ftp
password from <kbd>/dev/tty</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Example (non-working) script</h2>

<pre>
<kbd>#!/bin/sh
HOST='ftp.users.qwest.net'
USER='yourid'
PASSWD='yourpw'
FILE='file.txt'

ftp $HOST &lt;&lt;END_SCRIPT
user $USER
$PASSWD
put $FILE
quit
END_SCRIPT
exit 0
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The above script will just hang if run in the foreground (in an
xterm), or if run in the background (from a cron job), it will fail
to perform the work of transferring <kbd>file.txt</kbd>.</p>

<p><kbd>/dev/tty</kbd> names a strange, magic device. Each process
(more strictly each process group) has a different
<kbd>/dev/tty</kbd>, and you can not naively make ftp clients read
the password from some non-magic, yet convenient source, like a
"here document". When run in an xterm, the script above appears to
hang because it reads the password from <kbd>/dev/tty</kbd>. The
xterm constitutes the script's <kbd>/dev/tty</kbd>, so the script
waits for keyboard input.</p>

<h2>Example Working Script</h2>

<pre>
<kbd>#!/bin/sh
HOST='ftp.users.qwest.net'
USER='yourid'
PASSWD='yourpw'
FILE='file.txt'

ftp -n $HOST &lt;&lt;END_SCRIPT
quote USER $USER
quote PASS $PASSWD
put $FILE
quit
END_SCRIPT
exit 0
</kbd>
</pre>

<h2>The Tricks</h2>

<p>
Getting the password to the ftp server without having the ftp
client program read the password from <kbd>/dev/tty</kbd> requires
two tricks: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the <kbd>-n</kbd> option on the ftp client program to
prevent the ftp client from trying to log in immediately. That way,
the ftp client does not ask for a user ID and password. No use of
<kbd>/dev/tty</kbd>.</li>

<li>Use the ftp client program command <kbd>quote</kbd> to send
user ID and password to the ftp server.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You must the token that ends the "here document" (<kbd>END_SCRIPT</kbd> in
the example above) at the beginning of a line. Even if the <kbd>ftp</kbd>
command line and the login and transfer script are indented, <kbd>END_SCRIPT</kbd>
should appear with the 'E' as the first character of the line.
</p>

<h2>Further Refinements</h2>

The above <kbd>sh</kbd> script will spew lots of ftp client output
to standard output. Even if everything works perfectly, the user
running the above script will see lots of incomprehensible text
scrolling by quite rapidly. One refinement would send output to
different places: 

<pre>
<kbd>ftp -n $HOST &gt; /tmp/ftp.worked 2&gt; /tmp/ftp.failed &lt;&lt;END_SCRIPT
</kbd>
</pre>

One could further refine error handling by acting on the ftp client
program's exit status: 

<pre>
<kbd>ftp -n $HOST &gt; /tmp/ftp.worked 2&gt; /tmp/ftp.failed &lt;&lt;END_SCRIPT
<em>blah blah</em>
END_SCRIPT

EXITSTATUS=$?

if [ $EXITSTATUS != "0" ]
then
    # handle the error...
fi 
</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Except that the above doesn't always work - most FTP clients always
exit with a status of 0.  This leads to ugly "false negatives": the file
transfer fails, but the script doesn't detect the problem.</p>
<p>
One way to verify that a file transfer
took place - transfer it back:</p>
<pre><kbd>
#!/bin/sh

ftp -n &lt;&lt; END_SCRIPT
open $1
user $2 $3
put $4
get $4 retrieval.$$
bye
END_SCRIPT

if [ -f retrieval.$$ ]
then
	echo &quot;FTP of $4 to $1 worked&quot;
	rm -f retrieval.$$
else
	echo &quot;FTP of $4 did not work&quot;
fi
</kbd></pre>
<p>Regular FTPs there and back of large files can consume a lot of time.</p>

<h2>Control of ftp by a shell script</h2>

<p>One obvious improvement would have the ftp client program
controlled by the shell script. I don't think that would comprise
an impossible task, but I also don't think that it would have much
value. Scripting ftp transfer using <a
href="http://expect.nist.gov">expect</a> might cause you less pain.

<h3>Alternative #1</h3>
<p>I saw a second way of doing this in a usenet article:</p>

<pre>
<kbd>#!/bin/sh
USER=userid
PASSWD=userpw
ftp -n f2dev &lt;&lt;SCRIPT
user $USER $PASSWD
binary
get some.file
quit
SCRIPT
</kbd>
</pre>
<p>It still uses the "-n" trick, but it sends user ID and password
in the same "user" command.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Alternative #2</h3>
<strong>Use a .netrc file</strong>
<p>Linux, Unix and BSD users have the alternative of using a <kbd>.netrc</kbd>
file. The ftp man page documents the format of <kbd>.netrc</kbd>. To accomplish
the task of using ftp in a shell script you would have to fill out a
<kbd>.netrc</kbd> file something like this:</p>
<pre>
<kbd>
machine something.else.com
login myid
password mypassword
</kbd>
</pre>
<p>ftp demands that <kbd>.netrc</kbd> not have group or world read or
write permissions:</p>
<pre>
<kbd>
$ ls -l .netrc
-rw-------    1 bediger  users          51 Dec 16 13:30 .netrc
</kbd>
</pre>
<p>Using a  <kbd>.netrc</kbd> file has a few problems that may or may
not prevent you from using it.</p>
<ul>
<li>A shell scripkt that does FTP using .netrc is no longer self-contained.
You have to keep track of two files, which means that bugs can be less
than obvious.
</li>
<li>ftp reads it's user ID's  <kbd>.netrc</kbd>.  If you develop your script
under a given user ID, then put it in production under a second user ID,
you have to coordinate .netrc file contents between those two user IDs.
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Alternative #3</h3>
<p>
Apparently, the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck80.html">Ckermit</a> program from Columbia University understands
FTP.   You could use Ckermit to <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftpscripts.html">script FTP transfers</a>.
This looks to have advantages and disadvantages.  On the "pro" side, 
it appears that Ckermit can exit on various errors, like unknown user IDs,
or bad passwords.  On the "con" side, you have to have Ckermit. I don't
recall that it had a too onerous install, but it doesn't come with many
Linux distros these days, and it probably doesn't come with any vendor
Unix.
