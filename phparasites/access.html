<div id="subheader"><h2>Obtaining Access</h2></div>
<p>
Access to the honey pot's emulated WordPress administration
happened solely by automated username and password guessing.
Nobody used any WordPress exploits that I could detect.
This could be an artifact, as I allowed any user ID/password combo
to log in as the admin user.
</p>
<p>
Some of the password guessing programs are poorly designed and implemented. 
Some of the guessing probably doesn't work on real WordPress installations,
due to WordPress looking for certain cookies on login attempts. At least some
of the automated guessers don't put appropriate cookies in their guess
requests. Some of the guessers keep on guessing even after getting a
successful login, but that property is what makes them show up
as a "guessing session". <a href="login.html">Close examination</a> of how
malware gets downloaded and invoked shows that some brute force guessers do
stop guessing after success, then drop malware into place.
</p>
<p>
One guess contained a <a href="long.password">5,105 character-long "password string"</a>
that's apparently a concatenation of all the passwords loaded into that guesser.
The "password string" came from 202.179.22.211, which <kbd>p0f</kbd> 
says was running "Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP1+, 2003".
Nothing in <kbd>$_SERVER</kbd> and <kbd>$_REQUEST</kbd> for that guess
looks particularly unique.  I have to believe that either someone
botched the format of the candidate password file, or it was an
ineptly written guesser.
</p>
<p>
After I shut down the honey pot, my web server still suffered through long
sessions of guessing that just got 404s. The password guessing code doesn't
even bother to check the HTTP response.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Visualizing Guessing Sessions</h3></div>
<p>
The two charts below have the same X-axis time scale, allowing
the observer to note that some sessions have a large number of
unique IP addresses, while others have only a single IP address.
</p>
<a name="LOGINSPERDAY"><img src="wp_login.daily.count.png" alt="WordPress Login Attempts per day" /></a>
<img src="wp_login.daily.ip.png" alt="Unique IP addresses making WordPress Login Attempts per day" />
<p>
The sessions are more compact than the daily-count charts convey. 
The 2013-03-09 session actuall took place over 75 minutes, not over
the entire day.
</p>.
<img src="wp_login-2013-03-09.count.png" alt="WordPress Login Attempts per minute, 2013-03-09" />
<p>
10,001 login attempts, all from 178.151.216.53,
a Windows Vista or Windows 7 SP1 machine during
this period. It used HTTP 1.1 <kbd>Connection: Keep-alive</kbd> headers.
It used a single TCP connection for every 101 requests.
It made about 140 requests per minute.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Multi-machine Guessing Session Example</h3></div>
<p>
The highest number of distinct IP addresses in a single day happened on
2013-05-10.  During that day, my honey pot received 1991 log in attempts by
1358 different IP addresses, in three distinct sessions.  <kbd>p0f</kbd>
identifies about half of the the operating systems of the attackers as Windows (Vista, 7,
XP, 2000, 2003), but it also identifies about 640 of the login requests as
coming from various flavors of Linux.  Only 1 IP address tried to log in more
than 10 times, 267 IP addresses tried to log in twice,
and 939 IP addresses tried to log in a single time.
</p>
<img src="wp_login-2013-05-09.count.png" alt="WordPress Login Attempts per minute, 2013-05-10" />
<p>
Each of the 3 sessions shows what you might expect from a collection of unreliable servers:
it starts strong, then as human administrators discover the guessing, or machines or software
fail or get taken off-line, the number of guesses per minute tails off rapidly.
This looks quite different from the single-machine guessing session illustrated above,
which has a constant guess-per-minute rate over the entire span of the session.
</p>
<p>
I would call the 3 sessions "coordinated" based on the abrupt rise in
guesses-per-minute alone.  The IP addresses in the 3 sessions also used unique
passwords. Each session had about 600-650 password guesses, of which 550 - 600
of the passwords were unique to that session. In each of the 3 sessions, only
40-50 of the passwords were guessed more than once. Taken together, these have
to constitute multi-machine coordinated guessing sessions.
