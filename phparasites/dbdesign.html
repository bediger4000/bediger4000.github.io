<h1>Design of Database</h1>

<h2>Database</h2>
<p>

<h2>Visualization of DB</h2>

<p>
The above diagram
represents tables by rectangular blocks, has the table name in bold.
It lists column names in regular type in the blocks.
Foreign key fields have arrows pointing to the primary keys.
</p>
<h2>seq_no</h2>
<p>
Any request of the Apache web server ends up putting a line
in table <kbd>access_log</kbd>. That table has a column <kbd>seq_no</kbd>.
I made every effort to get a coherent, matching value of <kbd>seq_no</kbd>
for rows in table <kbd>p0f</kbd> (essentially for a TCP SYN packet) that make 
a request of TCP port 80.
</p>
<pre>
SELECT seq_no FROM access_log
WHERE ip_addr = <em>p0f from IP address</em>
AND request_dt = <em>p0f timestamp</em>
AND seq_no IS NOT NULL
AND seq_no NOT IN (
    SELECT seq_no
    FROM p0f
    WHERE from_addr = <em>p0f from IP address</em>
    AND seq_no IS NOT NULL
)
</pre>
<p>
When finding a <kbd>seq_no</kbd> value for a <kbd>p0f</kbd> record,
the above SQL tries to find a <kbd>seq_no</kbd> value from an Apache
<kbd>access_log</kbd> record that's already in the database, based on
matching IP address of the source, and timestamp.
Occasionally, the same IP address can make multiple HTTP requests per
second, so the "NOT IN" clause keeps the code from assigning the same
<kbd>seq_no</kbd> to two rows in table <kbd>p0f</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the <kbd>p0f</kbd> record and the <kbd>access_log</kbd> record
have timestamps that differ.  I ended up using this SQL as a second chance
to find a value of <kbd>seq_no</kbd>:
</p>
<pre>
SELECT seq_no FROM access_log 
WHERE ip_addr = <em>p0f from IP address</em>
AND (request_dt BETWEEN
   (CAST(<em>p0f timestamp</em> as timestamp with time zone) - INTERVAL '3 second') 
   AND
   (CAST(<em>p0f timestamp</em> as timestamp with time zone) + INTERVAL '3 second'))
AND seq_no not in (
   SELECT seq_no
   FROM p0f
   WHERE to_port = 80
   AND from_addr = <em>p0f from IP address</em> AND seq_no IS NOT NULL
)
</pre>
<p>
For the 6-second interval code above to work best, the <kbd>p0f</kbd> records
should present in chronological order. This maximizes the number of table
<kbd>p0f</kbd> rows that get a value of <kbd>seq_no</kbd>, and minimizes
the number of mismatches.
</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
Batch - revoke a set of inserts.  Each file full of <kbd>p0f</kbd>
records, or lines from <kbd>access_log</kbd> gets a single value of <kbd>batch_no</kbd>.
Corresponding rows in table <kbd>access_log</kbd> or <kbd>p0f</kbd> have that
value of <kbd>batch_no</kbd>.  If a file gets processed incorrectly, I can
delete all rows of that file based on value of <kbd>batch_no</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
Three "fact tables" exist, tables named <kbd>p0f</kbd>, <kbd>access_log</kbd>, <kbd>scan</kbd>
Each line in a <kbd>p0f.log</kbd> becomes a row in table <kbd>p0f</kbd>,
for example.
</p>
<p>
"_d" tables - dimension tables more or less.
Some shared between fact tables.
</p>
<p>
Four "link tables", doing many-to-many relationships.
