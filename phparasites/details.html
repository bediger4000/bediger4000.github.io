<div id="subheader"><h2>Honey Pot Details</h2></div>
<p>
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Apache HTTP Server</h3></div>
<p>
I ran the honey pot with an Apache HTTP server. I used Apache's <a
href=""><kbd>mod_rewrite</kbd></a> module to aid in spoofing requests for
(emulated) blogs whose URI I couldn't know in advance, and also for spoofing
requests for PHP files in plugins or themes that the fake blog had claimed to
successfully install, but actually had just saved the zip file.
</p>
<p>
I used an extended Apache log file format: <kbd>LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
</kbd>. A typical line in <kbd>access_log</kbd> looks like this:
</p>
<pre><kbd>192.168.1.114 - - [08/Jul/2013:22:16:46 -0600] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 403 179 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0"
</kbd></pre>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>p0f Passive Scanner</h3></div>
<p>
I ran <a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f.tgz">p0f</a> v2.0,
a passive identification daemon, on the same server.
This allows OS guessing/identification on a basis other than
the user agent string. A typical output line (one per SYN packet:
</p>
<pre><kbd>&lt;Thu Sep 26 21:26:15 2013&gt; 10.0.0.3:48234 - Linux 3.0-1 (1) (possibly Ubuntu 11.10, FC 16, Gentoo 11.2, OpenSUSE 12.x) (up: 247 hrs) -> 89.187.142.144:80 (distance 0, link: ethernet/modem)
</kbd></pre>
<p>
p0f v3  became available shortly after I started using p0f v2, but i like
the single-line format of p0f v2's output. I used
<a href="https://tools.netsa.cert.org/confluence/display/tt/p0f+fingerprints">fingerprint file p0f.fp.2012032901</a>.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Database</h3></div>
<p>
I used a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a> database to select and coordinate
<kbd>access_log</kbd> entries, <kbd>p0f</kbd> observations and what
information the WordPress blog emulation logged. It has a "star schema" layout, with 
three fact tables, and a number of supporting dimension tables.
</p>
<p>
It is pssible to match <kbd>p0f</kbd> OS identifications to Apache log
file entries, so my <a href="dbdesign.html">database design</a> does that as
thoroughly as possible. Since the Apache HTTP server runs the PHP
interpreter, it's relatively easy to match the per-request information
my honey pot and malware emulation code saved, to a given HTTP request,
since both have the
Internet Protocol address that the request came from, the URI that the
request wants, and a timestamp. The tricky parts involve not
duplicating matches between honey pot emulation-saved information and
a single Apache log file line. If an exact match on IP address, URI and
timestamp (that doesn't also match a previous honey pot request) doesn't exist,
you have to look for Apache log file entries within a few seconds of the
honey pot info's timestamp.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>Emulated Software</h3></div>
<p>
I captured HTML from a real WordPress 2.9.2 installation. I wrote small
amounts of PHP code to display the captured HTML appropriately.  The PHP that
executed on honey pot page access logged the values in <kbd>$_SERVER</kbd>,
<kbd>$_REQUEST</kbd>, <kbd>$_COOKIE</kbd>, and kept the files named in
<kbd>$_FILE</kbd>, along with other info.  Most of the interaction
with my fake-WordPress blog was with programs - the CSS files
referenced in the HTML rarely got requested. Any access by a real browser
would have requested CSS files, or at least <kbd>favicon.ico</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
The ability to appear to install malware was key to tricking
downloads of much of the malware. In addition to faking WordPress
theme and plugin downloads and installs, and faking accepting new posts,
I emulated parts of the
popular <a href="https://github.com/orbweb/PHP-SHELL-WSO">WSO 2.5.1</a> web shell.
I installed a WSO shell file on a second machine behind a firewall.
I captured HTML for the WSO login screen, the main screen and the results of
a successful file upload. I wrote <a href="pseudo_wso.phps">PHP code</a>
that served the various 
chunks of HTML at appropriate times. The PHP code also captured any
uploaded files, and recorded a lot of the information available to PHP
at the time of access.
I believe that generating WSO-like HTML that shows a file got
downloaded is essential to getting lots of downloads.
Showing a "main page" without the new file listed on it after a download
attempt doesn't seem to give
attackers the cue to try their download, and maybe download something else.
WSO emulators that show a directory listing with more than just the
last file it uploaded may draw more invocations of downloaded malware.
</p>
<p>
I also emulated some pieces of malware that came along:
an <a href="smtp.recon1.phps">STMP tester</a> downloaded via the
<a href="backdoors.html">7c334.php</a> backdoor,
and the <a href="emailers.html">qq.php emailer</a>.
I had to read and understand all code downloaded before
I could emulate it adequately, so I did not write
<kbd>qq.php</kbd> emulation in time to catch any spamming attempts.
I did catch malware with a <kbd>7c334.php</kbd> emulator.
