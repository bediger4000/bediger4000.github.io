<div id="subheader"><h2>Email Spam Tools</h2></div>
<p>
Attackers uploaded PHP source code that seems specifically
designed to send spam email.
Upon upload, the spam tools immediately get called
with what looks like well-known addresses to test them.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>qq.php</h3></div>
<p>
<kbd>qq.php</kbd> arrived as a file uploaded to <a href="wso.html">WSO</a>
from 188.165.215.67, four different times: 
 2013-06-26T10:33:35-06,
 2013-06-26T11:36:41-06,
 2013-07-02T09:02:19-06,
 2013-07-02T10:22:07-06.
</p>
<p>
Invoked 21 diffent times after upload, by 188.165.215.67 and 88.198.1.37,
4 times on 2013-07-02, 15 times on 2013-09-13T and two times on 2013-09-25.
The first 4 invocations by 188.165.215.67, the rest by 88.198.1.37.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>p0f</kbd> identifies 188.165.215.67 as "Windows Vista SP0/SP2, 7 SP0+, 2008 SP0".
<kbd>p0f</kbd> identifies 88.198.1.37 as "Linux 2.6 (newer, 3) or Mac OSX 10.3.1 (possibly FC 6, CentOS 5.x)".
I don't know what to make of the nearly 2-month gap between uploading
<kbd>qq.php</kbd>. and 88.198.1.37 invoking it.
</p>
<p>
I had ended my honey pot experiment by September 13, so I don't have any data
on what got sent to <kbd>qq.php</kbd> by 88.198.1.37. The four attempts at
invoking <kbd>qq.php</kbd> by 188.165.215.67 were all clearly intended as tests
of my honey pot host's SMTP system. The four invocations of "qq.php" had two
each using "stratigery.com" and "www.stratigery.com" as the host name part of
the URL.  The POST parameters passed to <kbd>qq.php</kbd> involved a parameter
named "body", with values like this:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;TEST http://www.stratigery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/qq.php&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>and</p/>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;TEST http://stratigery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/qq.php&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
That constitutes an SMTP test. It seems to me that
using gmail.com as an SMTP server and email reader would prevent you from
seeing some or all of the relevant SMTP headers. Perhaps it isn't
worth the risk of running your own SMTP server to see them.
Apparently, "davidberns60@gmail.com" is interested in the contents of
these emails.
</p>
<p>
The <kbd>qq.php</kbd>. source code is just a wrapper around code from the
open source <a href="https://github.com/Synchro/PHPMailer">PHPMailer</a> project.
Values of <kbd>$Version</kbd> in the code indicates PHPMailer version 5.2.2,
and it has no comments - they've all been stripped from the code.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>accountTu39</h3></div>
<p>
A fairly versatile spamming tool, <kbd>accountTu39.php</kbd> allows the user to
send batches of SMTP emails to a list of (firstname, lastname, email address)
tuples, specify a subject and message body, and customize the subject line and
message body by macro substitution of the victim's first name and last name in
both.  Extra HTTP parameters allow the user to send base64-encoded HTTP
parameters to <kbd>accountTu39.php</kbd>, and get debugging output from
spamming sessions.
</p>
<p>
The original upload has a weird attempts at obfuscation - all functions and
variables got renamed mechanically, all comments stripped out, all indentations
and end-of-line characters removed. Seems like a corporate-style obfuscation,
since it doesn't involve <kbd>eval()</kbd> or <kbd>preg_replace()</kbd>
executing base64-encoded PHP.
</p>
<p>
This code has self-contained SMTP implementation, complete with multiple 
fall-back alternatives to create a socket.  It probably runs
on many PHP versions, and isn't Windows or Linux specific.
The code also allows the names in HTTP POST request name/value pairs to
take on arbitraray values: only the first character in a name matters.
This is probably an attempt to avoid intrusion detection systems when
invoking a freshly installed <kbd>accountTu39.php</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
This code arrived 2013-06-24T09:51:03-06, via WSO "uploadFile".
By 2013-07-01T13:35:38-06, the same IP address was uploading an
evolved version. Because the obfuscation makes development
almost impossible, it would seem that the attackers have the original,
unobfuscated code, develop that, and re-obfuscate.
</p>
<p>
The attachers invoked <kbd>accountTu39.php</kbd> 3 times in the next 4
seconds after upload. These invocations were pretty clearly a test run,
sending The string "Do you remember me?" to robotsk@stat-run.info. The
nominal sender of the test email is one "John Smith", infozz@stat-run.info.
Once again, we note multiple attempts at failure-prone operations.
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3>823491.php</h3></div>
<p>
Just for variety, someone from 91.213.8.225 uploaded (only a single time, via WSO shell) an interactive
bulk email web page. The other email spamming tools don't even pretend
to offer a human-user-interface, but this PHP generates a
<a href="823491.html">plain, but serviceable, human interface</a>.
It might be possible to use it programmatically, as people certainly
use the WSO web shell as a file uploading service.
I have no record of it any invocation.
</p>
<p>
The upload of <kbd>823491.php</kbd>. seems automatic: 91.213.8.225 made 4 HTTP
requests in 3 seconds. The sequence went like this:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>GET <kbd>mod_menu.php</kbd>, the WSO web shell file name.</li>
	<li>POST pass=FDY17c to <kbd>mod_menu.php</kbd>: send it a password. WSO, and my 
	emulation, set a cookie based on the MD5 hash of the hostname,
	and the MD5-hashed password.
	</li>
	<li>Upload <kbd>823491.php</kbd> file to WSO, using the "uploadFile" action
		of WSO.  Send the cookie from step 2 along in HTTP headers.  </li>
	<li>Re-invoke <kbd>mod_menu.php</kbd>, sending the cookie from step 2 along in HTTP headers.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
Steps (1) and (2) can actually be circumvented by sending an extra HTTP
parameter, something like <kbd>pass=45000045</kbd>, in the step (3) call to
"uploadFile" action. WSO doesn't check if a user retrieves a login page first
(step (1)) or if the login cookie gets set with an extra parameter while
requesting an "uploadFile".  Other code does this exact circumvention.
</p>
<p>
The "default action" of WSO web shells is "FilesMan", which ends up displaying
a listing of WSO's working directory. This is also the directory that the file
named "823491.php" should appear. Unfortunately, my emulation code would only
show "823491.php" in the files listing in the HTML returned to 91.213.8.225
after step 3. The extra invocation of <kbd>mod_menu.php</kbd> in step 4
wouldn't show "823491.php" in the directory listing. I suspect this caused the
program at 91.213.8.225 to assume an error or a trap, and just move on. Very
clever, Mister Bond!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div id="subsubheader"><h3><a name="POSTMAN">PostMan Full 3.5-insec</a></h3></div>
<p>
This interactive spamming tool has some interest in that it was not installed
via WSO "uploadFile" action, but rather arrived along with a WSO file, and an
<a href="recon.html#URLPHP">SMTP recon program</a> in the attacker's favorite
"Tumblr Importer" plugin.  Attackers invoked the SMTP recon program immediately
after upload. That got a WSO login page, as I did not emulate the SMTP recon
program.  PostMan Full 3.5 was never invoked.
</p>
<p>
Googling for "PostMan Full 3.5" yeilds some interesting things.  The copy
downloaded to my honey pot claims that it's "by Ghostx", and other copies do
too, but some claim they're by "&lt;&lt;&lt;AZ&gt;&gt;&gt;", or "unknown" or
"Januardy" or "r3v3ng4ns".
</p>
<p>
That matches up with the internals - the code is clearly hacked on by many.
The actual SMTP email is done by a very
early (circa 2003) version of the <a
href="https://github.com/Synchro/PHPMailer">PHPMailer</a>.  The PHPMailer code is
clearly supposed to be password-encrypted, but someone along the way has
changed whatever password encryption previously existed into a simple,
password-less, character-replacement scheme.  There's a cryptic comment (in
English and Portugese) at the start of the code about how "YOUR PASSWORD IS
ONLY YOURS!" and you're not supposed to share it. So much for showing respect
to fellow spammers or "bulkers" or whatever self-serving euphemism they use
now.
</p>
<p>
After leaving the <a href="copyright.php.html">HTML for a defanged "PostMan Full 3.5"</a>
available for a few days, I note that HTML gets hits by referral from Google.
It appears that people google for some identifiable phrase in the HTML,
visit the URLs provided, and send spam emails via "PostMan Full v3.5" as
installed by some other miscreant. It may be worth including an emulated
"PostMan Full v3.5-insec" PHP program in future honey pots, just to draw
spammers and see what they send out.
</p>
<p>
Some folks test PostMan Full 3.5, trying to get it to send a test email
to an address multiple times. Others appear to just use the form indiscriminately.
